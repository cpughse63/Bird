# Bird

## Project Planning

Goal:

Making a bird, with a raspberry pi on it, that will flap it's wings, know when it's at it's top altitude, and measure it's own acceleration.

FIRST STEP: START WITH RUBBER BAND ORNITHOPTER
Some people don't want to start with a rubber-band-powered ornithopter, because it doesn't seem technologically advanced. But the rubber-powered ornithopter will teach you important concepts and skills that you will find useful when you start building more complex ornithopters. You will progress more rapidly by having this foundation. The rubber-powered ornithopter itself has become highly developed, with some very unique designs and advanced concepts.

The wing membrane can be made from a plastic film. This is suitable, even for very large RC ornithopters. Look for a crisp, "cellophane" type of plastic, instead of a limp saran-wrap type. Sometimes a woven fabric is used. The fabric wings can look very professional. However, it will be difficult to find a woven material that is crisp, lightweight, and airtight. Some of the fabrics specially made for kites may be appropriate. The Ornithopter Design Manual has more information on assembling fabric wings.

Notice one thing about the servo-powered wings. The servo for the right wing is going clockwise to raise the wing. Meanwhile, the servo for the left wing is going counter-clockwise. For this reason, the actual pulse width that you send to the servo is going to be different for the two servos. If the neutral position is 1500 μs, then the top of the upstroke might be 1800 μs for the right wing, and 1200 μs for the left wing. At full power, you will want to flap the wings through an angle of about 60 degrees.

We can raise or lower the flapping arc to make the bird go up or down. Raising the wings results in a higher line of thrust, which points the nose of the bird downward. Lowering the flapping arc gives you a lower line of thrust and pitches the bird up toward the sky. This works in flapping or gliding flight, and it has the same effect as the elevator control on an airplane. Since the left and right servos are normally running in opposite directions to flap the wings, we are going to add to one servo pulse while subtracting from the other.

Mylar, a trade-name for thin sheets of a plastic known as polyethylene terephthalate. This material is extremely strong and very light.

For gliding, we set the wings at a certain position, which is usually about 15 degrees above horizontal.

High flying bird
Were gonna paint our birdlike so cutely
It’s gonna make cute chirping noises
Cute little wings that flap
Our goal is to create a mechatronic flying machine shaped as a bird with wings
Wings made of some sort of tent material- needs to be light
Framing should be plastic so it’s not too heavy?
Maybe pvc pipes for the edges of the wings
Actually use tent stakes 
Maybe fiberglass tent things- light and strong\
Carbon fiber rods
Bamboo rods



What we need to build:
A frame that is light, but strong
Needs to hold 3 servos, motor, raspberry pi, battery
Wings, tail
Use tent?


Dimensions: 
Body: 14 inches long
